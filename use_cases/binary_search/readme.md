# "Binary Search" Use Case

This use case is inspired by the [demonstration] of implementing the Binary Search algorithm during the presentation "Inventing on Principle" by Bret Victor.

It focuses on the programming experience, improved by a "live" programming environment - level 4 or 5 on [Tanimoto's hierarchy][liveness].

Essential Elements:

- example input
	- hypothetical messages
	- multiple examples -> half TDD
- complete history
	- hypothetical histories
	- forking/merging
- unified state (code and data)
	- visibility of state and it's changes

	
Other Elements:

- completely asynchronous messages
- messages are Zells, too
- Zell discovery
- message discovery
